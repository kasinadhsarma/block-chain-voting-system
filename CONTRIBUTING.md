# Contributing to VoteX Blockchain Voting System

We love your input! We want to make contributing to the VoteX blockchain voting system as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature/amazing-feature`
5. Open a Pull Request

### Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md or relevant documentation with details of changes if applicable
2. Update the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent
3. Ensure all tests are passing
4. Ensure your code follows the code style of the project
5. You may merge the Pull Request once you have the sign-off of at least one other developer, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the reviewer to merge it for you
